    <p>
        Only when an item is out of stock, delivered incorrectly, or is delayed by more than seven days from its
        scheduled arrival date and the retailer ships the item without notifying the client are returns and refunds
        permitted. The only option available is replacement if the product is in the right style but has a defect in its
        quality.<br>
        Any issues with the quality of the items brought on by people after receiving them will not be accepted for
        returns or refunds, and it is not eligible to returns and refund. Within 30 days of the order's shipment date,
        all returned items must be in brand-new condition. If not, the retailer reserves the right to refuse the return.<br>
